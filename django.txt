#use reverse
from django.urls import reverse  #it get a name and reverse or make a url by that.
but you should use the name at urls.py at urlpatterns at path    .e.g
path('path_url<var1><var2>..',views...., name="path_name") #it take a name to path and has been used in place of 'path_url'
#how to use reverse???
from django.urls import reverse 
path_vari = reverse('name of the path .e.g path_name',args=[var1,var2])
#path name was an entered name at urls.py at path and their variables(args) at path must be in the list 
and then we have a full url of made application at path_vari
#then we can use it by:'{path_vari}' at string.

#to use html tags at views....
our_reply = f'<html-tag> messages...</html-tag>'  #it run html tag at browser.
and send our_reply by HttpResponse(our_reply)


#work with templates   *********
make a file named 'templates' and make another at that named our application name so ...
our-app/templates/our-app/
then make html-file at that path.



#use templates
first make a dir at app_name_folder
app_name_folder/templates/app_name_folder
then we make html template at that folder: app_name_folder/templates/app_name_folder
after that go to views and --> 
from django.template.loader import render_to_string  #it changes html templates or file at app_name_folder to string at the path gien.
our_html_string = render_to_string( 'app_name_folder/html1.html') #render html1.html to string 
then
return HttpResponse(our_html_string)  #clearly done after good pathing at urls.py.



we can use complete address at settings.py at TEMPLATES at 'dir':"our_path" and we don't sign our app 
to INSTALLED_APP
