#use reverse
from django.urls import reverse  #it get a name and reverse or make a url by that.
but you should use the name at urls.py at urlpattern at path    .e.g
path('path_url<var1><var2>..',views...., name="path_name") #it take a name to path and has been used in place of 'path_url'
#how to use reverse???
from django.urls import reverse 
path_vari = reverse('name of the path .e.g path_name',args=[var1,var2])
#path name was an entered name at urls.py at path and their variables(args) at path must be in the list 
and then we have a full url of made application at path_vari
#then we can use it by:'{path_vari}' at string.
